# Algorithm Solutions

This repository contains my collection of solutions for various algorithmic problems provided by [Baekjoon Online Judge](https://www.acmicpc.net/) and [programmers school](https://school.programmers.co.kr/).

## Language

The solutions are coded using `C, Java, Rust`. Each solution contains its own `README.md` file describing the problem, my understanding, and the approach I used in coming up with the solution.

## Note

The execution time and memory usage for each solution may differ depending on factors such as the state of the server at the time of submission, the language used, and optimization of the compiler and interpreter.

If you have any questions or encounter any issues, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. 

Happy Coding!
